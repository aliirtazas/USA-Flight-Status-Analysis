**Flights Insights - Exploring Flight Data Patterns Across the USA**

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) manages a staggering
volume of air traffic, handling approximately 16 million
flights annually, showcasing the immense scale and complexity
of the U.S. aviation system. On a daily basis, the FAA oversees
45,000 flights, with a remarkable 5,400 aircraft navigating the
skies during peak operational hours. This extensive network of
flights operates across a vast landscape, facilitated by a total
of 19,633 airports throughout the United States.

**Motivation**

The motivation behind undertaking this project lies in addressing the pervasive challenges within the airline industry surrounding flight delays. Flight delays, a persistent concern for airlines, airports, and travelers, can result in operational inefficiencies, financial losses, and disruptions to travel plans. By delving into the Flight dataset, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and
2
insights that can inform strategies to mitigate delays and enhance the overall efficiency of air travel.
Understanding the factors contributing to flight delays is of paramount importance for several stakeholders. For airlines, this knowledge can empower informed decision-making in scheduling, resource allocation, and operational planning. Travelers, the end-users of air travel services, can make more informed decisions and better navigate their journeys within the United States with knowledge about potential delays and their root causes.

**Data**

The data was obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FGK&QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr). The data was downloaded in .csv format, resulting in download files amounting to a size of 10 GB. For simplicity in pre-processing and data analysis, we converted the files into .parquet format, resulting in a file size of 2 GB.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this research project has delved into the
intricate realm of flight data patterns in the USA, offering a
holistic understanding of the challenges and dynamics within
the aviation industry. Through a meticulous exploration of the
Flight Dataset spanning five years, from 2018 to 2022, the
study has unraveled temporal trends, operational efficiencies,
and the profound impact of external factors such as the
COVID-19 pandemic on flight travel. The insights gained from
analyzing departure delays, cancellations, and taxi-in/out times
contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the factors
influencing air travel disruptions. By comparing airlines based
on reliability metrics, the research provides valuable benchmarks
for both industry stakeholders and passengers, facilitating
informed decision-making. The commitment to data
quality and relevance, evident in the detailed data collection
and pre-processing strategies, underscores the rigor of this
study. Ultimately, the research aspires to catalyze positive
changes within the aviation sector, fostering a data-driven
approach to address challenges, enhance operational efficiency,
and improve the overall travel experience for millions of
individuals.
