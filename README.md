**Flights Insights - Exploring Flight Data Patterns Across the USA**

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) manages a staggering
volume of air traffic, handling approximately 16 million
flights annually, showcasing the immense scale and complexity
of the U.S. aviation system. On a daily basis, the FAA oversees
45,000 flights, with a remarkable 5,400 aircraft navigating the
skies during peak operational hours. This extensive network of
flights operates across a vast landscape, facilitated by a total
of 19,633 airports throughout the United States.

**Motivation**

The motivation behind undertaking this project lies in addressing the pervasive challenges within the airline industry surrounding flight delays. Flight delays, a persistent concern for airlines, airports, and travelers, can result in operational inefficiencies, financial losses, and disruptions to travel plans. By delving into the Flight dataset, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and

insights that can inform strategies to mitigate delays and enhance the overall efficiency of air travel.
Understanding the factors contributing to flight delays is of paramount importance for several stakeholders. For airlines, this knowledge can empower informed decision-making in scheduling, resource allocation, and operational planning. Travelers, the end-users of air travel services, can make more informed decisions and better navigate their journeys within the United States with knowledge about potential delays and their root causes.
